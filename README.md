### MY PROCESS

## Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap 5
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript

This was an easier task for me because I am more comfortable writing codes with logic. I get to implement a task the way I like.
It was also easier because we were taught how to use Bootstrap during the week. 
I will definitely be doing more Javascript projects.
